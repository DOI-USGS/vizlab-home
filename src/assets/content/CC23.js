In most years, the largest cause of deaths are storms (hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones). Some individual events stand out, for example deaths due to the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens and to the 2018 Camp Fire in California. For each type of disaster, a timeseries of deaths is plotted as a horizontal band of varying height. The height corresponds to the number of deaths caused by that type of disaster. The bands are stacked, and total height equals total deaths across all disaster types. The stacking order varies by year, so that the band with the most deaths is on top. The bands therefore cross one another, showing changes in deaths over time and the top causes of deaths in each year.'

The points form a figure eight shape, illustrating the concept of hysteresis - a phenomenon in which the value of a physical property lags behind changes in the effect causing it. For example, stream temperature changes in response to air temperature, but the stream warms more slowly than air in the mornings, and cools more slowly than air in the evenings. If water temperature tracked stream temperature exactly, the points would fall on a straight line, rather than in a figure eight.'

RCP are scenarios constructed to represent how well we can curb and contain greenhouse gas emissions. RCP 2.6 implements the most aggressive strategies, while RCP 8.5 is "business-as-usual". The model results show increasing effects on spawning onset and end dates with less aggressive RCP. For the 2012 to 2099 model period, spawning is projected to start 15 days earlier on average than during the 1950 to 2012 period.
