The fourth panel shows a skyline with a storm; the text reads: \'Later that day...\' The fifth panel depicts a chart where the length and size of the water droplets indicate the average water savings by state.

A map and bar chart are synchronized to show the onset of spring as the year progresses, with southernmost parts of the U.S. first entering spring and rising up through parts of the midwest and east coast. On the west coast, spring first appears in southern California and Arizona, moving up towards Washington along the coast, while the interior western states remain in winter. Compared to the 30 year average, spring timing is generally consistent.'
