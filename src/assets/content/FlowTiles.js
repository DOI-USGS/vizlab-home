Streamflow conditions are quantified using percentiles comparing the past month’s flow levels to the historic record for each streamgage. During the month of May, wetter than normal conditions persisted for much of the Western U.S., while the Southern Plains, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and parts of the Eastern U.S., such as the Mid-Atlantic and Florida, saw drought conditions.'

During the month of January, winter storms brought wetter than normal conditions for much of the U.S. Concurrently, California saw wetter than normal conditions as winter storms brought heightened precipitation. At the national scale, many sites experienced wetter than normal conditions as winter storms conditions persisted across the West Coast and Eastern U.S.'
